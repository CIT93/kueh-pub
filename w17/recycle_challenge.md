i would approach this like how we been doing. the only difference is i would already do the calculations before hand.
for example my inputs would be-
    -dont recycle = 24pts
    -do recycle glass = 20pts
    -do recycle glass & plastic = 16pts
    -do recycle glass, plastic, & paper = 12pts
    -do recycle glass, plastic, paper, & Aluminum = 8pts
    -do recycle glass, plastic, paper, Aluminum, & Steel = 4pts
    -do recycle glass, plastic, paper, Aluminum, Steel, & food waste = 0pts
